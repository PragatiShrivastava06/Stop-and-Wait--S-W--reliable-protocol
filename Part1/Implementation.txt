SFTP: Reliable Transfer over a Reliable Channel
Step 1:
 There are two classes: a)sftp_client.c b)sftp_server.c
 sftp_client.c will first create a File object from the input file location
 Make sure that you change the file path accordingly to point to the location of your specific input file.
Step 2:
 The input file can be a text file or an image file.
 The sftp_client.c class is responsible for reading the bytes of data from the input file and send the data in chunks
of bytes to the Server side.
Step 3:
 The sftp_server.c class will then check for the incoming packet of data, break the incoming chunks of data
(10 bytes) into updated chunks (5 bytes).
 The sftp_server.c class will then write the data to the output file.

Execution Steps:
1) Make sure that you have the input file (text file/image file) ready.
2) Correctly specify the name of the output file with full path (text file/image file).
3) Specify the correct path of the input file in the sftp_client.c class
4) Compile both the classes first.
5) Firstly execute the following class: sftp_server.c
6) Secondly execute the class sftp_client.c
7)Check the contents of the output file.
